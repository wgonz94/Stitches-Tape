            I was the designer for two weddings both happening within weeks of
            each other. One wedding party had 6 bridesmaids and the other had
            10. I had to lug around several binders that held everyone's
            measurements, color preferences, and notes I had taken for each gown
            that would be made. I misplaced one of the binders and lost months
            worth of data. I was never able to retrieve the original
            measurements which was disappointing to all. It added unnecessary
            extra work and hastle. Needless to say, the bride wasn't pleased. A
            friend later told me about S&T. This would have been my lifesaver
            had I had this tool at that time.
